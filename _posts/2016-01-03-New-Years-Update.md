title: New Years Update
---

<p>Hello, fellow users.</p>
<p>The new year has officially begun, and that means a new year ahead of us for our users and us as a business.</p>
<p>Later this year, we will be making some larger changes to our hosting changes, some of which include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Updating our websites design to a more modernest version, using the latest Bootstrap 4.0 (currently in alpha-testing) as our main base to build off of.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Adding new hosting packages.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>And much more to come!</p>
